In this paper, we propose a method that can adapt new categories using warm start parameters and deep feature representations. In order to obtain efficient feature representations, we first train a deep neural network as our feature extractor. we achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Food-101 dataset. We also show that deep representation can alleviate the dataset bias and can be used for adaptation efficiently. We propose a method that can adapt new food categories with deep representation. By learning one new category and warm start with the parameters from negative classifier in each step, our method shows improved result compared to method without warm start.

Since the idea of warm start can achieve a better result with just a few training iterations, Our future work can be a natural extension of this work: learning efficient shallow model from deep representations when the target examples are limited, such as one shot learning etc. In this scenario, randomly pick few examples from each categories could not be the best solution. Sophisticated pooling strategy could be a possible way to best eliminate the data bias.
